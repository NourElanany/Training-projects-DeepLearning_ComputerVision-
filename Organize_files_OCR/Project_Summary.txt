Project Name: Organize_files_OCR

Description:
This project is an "Ultimate Photo Organizer" that uses Artificial Intelligence to automatically categorize images into distinct classes (e.g., bikes, cars, cats, documents, dogs, flowers, horses, humans). It leverages a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for classification and integrates OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from images identified as documents. A Tkinter-based GUI makes it easy for users to select folders and organize their photo collections.

Methodology (What happened):
1.  **Data Preparation**: The dataset (approx. 2500 images) was split into training and validation sets using `image_dataset_from_directory`.
2.  **Model Training**: Utilized Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2. The base model weights were frozen, and a custom classification head (Global Average Pooling, Dropout, Dense) was added and trained for 10 epochs.
3.  **Classification**: The trained model predicts the category of input images.
4.  **OCR Integration**: For images classified as "document", Tesseract OCR (or EasyOCR) text extraction is performed.
5.  **Organization Logic**: A script (`organizer.py`) moves images into subfolders based on their predicted class.
6.  **User Interface**: Developed a GUI (`org_ui.py`) using Tkinter to provide a user-friendly way to interact with the system.

Benefits:
-   **Efficiency**: Automates the tedious task of manually sorting thousands of photos.
-   **Smart Document Handling**: Goes beyond simple sorting by making document text accessible.
-   **High Accuracy**: Achieves high classification performance through transfer learning.
-   **User-Friendly**: Accessible to non-technical users via a graphical interface.

Accuracy:
-   **Validation Accuracy**: 98.20% (achieved at Epoch 10).
-   **Validation Loss**: 0.0445.
-   The model demonstrates excellent generalization on the validation set, reliably distinguishing between the 8 categories.

Learnings:
-   Implementing Transfer Learning with TensorFlow/Keras and MobileNetV2.
-   Building desktop GUI applications with Tkinter.
-   Integrating OCR libraries (Tesseract/EasyOCR) into a computer vision pipeline.
-   Handling file system operations for automated organization.
