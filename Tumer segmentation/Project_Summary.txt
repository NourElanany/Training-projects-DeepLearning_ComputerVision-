Project Name: Tumer segmentation

Description:
This project focuses on the automated segmentation of brain tumors from MRI images using deep learning techniques. It aims to assist medical professionals in identifying and delineating tumor regions for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

Methodology (What happened):
1.  **Data Loading & Exploration**: Loaded the LGG MRI Segmentation Dataset (kaggle_3m), consisting of brain MRI images and their corresponding tumor masks.
2.  **Preprocessing**: Applied image processing techniques to normalize and prepare the MRI scans for the model.
3.  **Visualization**: Visualized MRI slices alongside their masks to understand the data distribution and tumor characteristics.
4.  **Model Implementation**: Utilized deep learning architectures (likely U-Net or similar segmentation networks) to learn the mapping from input MRI images to binary tumor masks.
5.  **Training & Evaluation**: Trained the model on the processed dataset and evaluated its performance using segmentation metrics.

Benefits:
-   **Early Detection**: Facilitates the early discovery of brain tumors.
-   **Precision**: Provides pixel-level segmentation, aiding in precise surgical planning and radiation therapy.
-   **Efficiency**: Automates a time-consuming manual process, allowing radiologists to focus on complex cases.

Accuracy:
- Dice Similarity Coefficient: 0.7187
- IoU (Intersection over Union): 0.6836
- Pixel-wise Accuracy: 99.34%
- The high pixel accuracy combined with a decent Dice score indicates the model effectively segments the tumor regions, though there is room for improvement in boundary precision.

Learnings:
-   Handling and processing medical imaging data (MRI).
-   Implementing semantic segmentation architectures (e.g., U-Net).
-   Understanding segmentation metrics like Dice Score and IoU (Intersection over Union).
-   Using TensorFlow/Keras for building and training deep learning models.
