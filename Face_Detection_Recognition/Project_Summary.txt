Project Name: Face Detection & Recognition

Description:
This project implements a real-time face recognition system using a webcam. It combines robust face detection with deep learning-based facial embedding generation to identify individuals.

Methodology (What happened):
1.  **Face Detection**: Utilized the YOLOv8 model (`YoloV8 Face.pt`) to detect faces within the video frame with high speed and accuracy.
2.  **Preprocessing**: Detected faces are cropped and resized to 112x112 pixels, normalized to the range [0, 1].
3.  **Feature Extraction**: Employed the ArcFace model (with a ResNet34 backbone) to map face images into a 512-dimensional vector space.
4.  **Recognition**: Calculated Cosine Similarity between the live face embedding and a pre-saved database of embeddings (`Face Recognition.csv`).
5.  **Matching**: If the similarity score exceeds a threshold (default 0.3), the face is identified; otherwise, it is labeled as "Unknown".

Benefits:
-   **Security**: Can be used for secure access control systems.
-   **Automation**: Useful for automated attendance tracking.
-   **Efficiency**: YOLOv8 and ArcFace provide a good balance between speed and accuracy for real-time applications.

Accuracy:
-   The project uses a recognition threshold of 0.3.
-   The ArcFace model typically achieves over 99% accuracy on standard benchmarks like LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild).
-   *Note: Specific accuracy on your custom dataset depends on the quality and quantity of the registration images.*

Learnings:
-   How to integrate object detection (YOLO) with recognition models.
-   Understanding facial embeddings and vector space math (Cosine Similarity).
-   Real-time video processing with OpenCV.
-   The importance of preprocessing (alignment, resizing) for deep learning models.
